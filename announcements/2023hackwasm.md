# Mission
Create a distinctive DeFi-oriented DApp (if possible) by leveraging our latest feature, the Dynamic Link, within the CosmWasm ecosystem designed to operate on the Finschia testnet.

Finschia, a hub chain powered by the Ostracon consensus engine, presents an ideal platform for the deployment of diverse DApps. While we have witnessed the successful implementation of numerous NFT-related DApps on our chain in the past, we are particularly excited about the potential emergence of innovative DeFi-oriented DApps during this hackathon, which will undoubtedly broaden our horizons.

For this challenge, participants are encouraged to develop a CosmWasm contract. While there are no specific limitations, incorporating advanced features such as the Dynamic Link for inter-contract communication or utilizing the IBC protocol to enable cross-chain DApp functionality will earn additional points. We eagerly await the development of exceptional DeFi-oriented DApps across various domains, including but not limited to Payment, Lending, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), Liquid Staking, Insurance, Bonds, Credit Rating, Asset Management, Risk Assessment/Management, and Asset Tokenization.

# Requirements
* You must use finschia-SDK & our custom wasm module to develop your CosmWasm contract.
* Your application must run on our testnet.
* Leverage the Dynamic Link & IBC features if you can.
* We value creativity over implementation. However, in the absence of originality, the completeness of the DApp becomes a crucial factor in the evaluation process.
